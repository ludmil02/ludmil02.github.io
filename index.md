**Overview:** Since July 2011, Ihave been holding a Full Professor position at the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.psu.edu/), [The Pennsylvania State University](http://www.psu.edu/) 

I graduated from the (the site is in Bulgarian) [Mathematics High School in Blagoevgrad](http://www.pmg-blg.com/), Bulgaria (class of 1981) 

I received my Ph.D. degree in [Mathematics from Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski"](https://www.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/en) in Sofia, Bulgaria.

I am working in the general area of computational mathematics. My research is focused on numerical methods for partial differential equations; numerical linear algebra; multilevel methods for linear systems and optimization; nonlinear approximation tools in compression of data and machine learning; and the applications of such mathematical techniques in hydrogeology, resource economics, physics and other sciences.
